# Remove-duplicates-excel

To remove duplicated rows from excel file and replace it by one row with mean values in columns.

__Put the excel file name for processing as an argument.__

I need this code for my workflow and, at the same time, this is a test exercise for Pandas module.

Sample result in graphical form:

Included test file (test11.xlsx) is the result of measurement of noise RC-filter. File consists of 6 columns:
1. frequency
2. Amplitude of (Channel1-Channel2)
3. transmission in dB (plotted on the sample result graph)
4. Amplitude of (Channel1)
5. Amplitude of (Channel2)
6. Amplitude of (Channel1) - Amplitude of (Channel2)

Column 3 is plotted on test graph.
